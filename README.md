# Color Identification Project

A Python-based project to identify colors from images or user input. This application uses image processing techniques and a pre-defined dataset of colors to detect and display the color name for a given pixel or region.

---

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Upload an image to identify colors at specific points.
- **Real-Time Color Detection**: Identify colors from a live feed (if extended with OpenCV).
- **Predefined Color Dataset**: Matches detected colors with a dataset of over 1000 color names.
- **User Interaction**: Click anywhere on the image to get the color name and RGB values.


---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV: For image processing.
  - Pandas: To handle the dataset of color names.
  - Tkinter (optional): For creating a graphical user interface.
- **Dataset**: CSV file containing color names and their RGB values.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rahulagarwal086/color-identification-python-project.git
   cd color-identification-python-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure Python is installed on your system, then install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python pandas
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python color_identifier.py
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Run the script**: Execute the `color_identifier.py` file.
2. **Upload an image** (if applicable): Provide an image file to detect colors.
3. **Click on a pixel**: The application will display the name and RGB values of the color at the clicked point.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a live camera feed for real-time color detection.
- Extend the dataset with additional color names and values.
- Build a standalone desktop application with a GUI.
